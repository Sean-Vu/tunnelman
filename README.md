The premise of this project was to create a 2D pixel art game that utilizes object-oriented programming practices and data structures to implement enemy-player interaction, level-based progression, and player-environment interaction. 

The player is represented as an oil miner and is subsequently chased by protestors to deter him from finding oil. 

The player can pick up objects in the environment like gold to bribe the protestor to leave him alone or water pools to deter the protestor directly by shooting.
